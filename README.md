# Truex Kepler Reference App

Sample app for TAR Kepler integration.

TODO:

* configure / set up
* build steps
* getting started, pointers to TAR docs, e.g. like HTML5 CTV ref app
* Usage examples

Dev note:
* if the Kepler stick OS updates fail, you can factory reset the device as follows:
* We are recommending that you either 1) Run the shallow factory reset command: https://developer.amazon.com/docs/kepler-tv/troubleshoot-fire-tv-stick.html
  Or 2) Trigger factory reset from remote: Press and hold Back and right side of the navigation circle together for 10 seconds.
